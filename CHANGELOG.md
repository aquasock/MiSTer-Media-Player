# Changelog

All notable project milestones are documented here.

This project is still in active pre-release development, so entries are organized by development phase rather than semantic version number.

## Unreleased — Phase 1R

Planned next milestone:

- add an alternate DDR frame bank for the second decoded picture;
- preserve the currently displayed frame until the next frame is fully stored;
- publish/swap the display frame only at a controlled boundary;
- retain the single-parser successive-picture architecture;
- preserve the timing/CDC discipline established in Phase 1P.

## Phase 1Q — Successive I-picture decode

- Proved two consecutive supported I-picture decodes in hardware.
- Reused a single proven H.262 parser by locally re-arming it between pictures.
- Kept picture 1 stored/displayed while picture 2 traversed parser, inverse quantization, IDCT, and reconstruction.
- Removed an earlier duplicated-parser diagnostic that introduced slight color-image flicker.
- Hardware acceptance: both diagnostic streams pass, image is stable, USER completion behavior is correct.

## Phase 1P — Timing and CDC closure

- Closed the real 54 MHz decoder and 40 MHz video timing paths.
- Pipelined and balanced inverse-quantization and IDCT arithmetic where required.
- Synchronized reset release independently in each destination clock domain.
- Enabled synchronized DCFIFO asynchronous-clear handling.
- Narrowed timing exceptions to intentional synchronizer boundaries rather than broad clock-domain false paths.
- Final accepted setup and recovery reports had zero total negative slack on the decoder and video clocks.

## Phase 1O — Full-precision DDR frame storage and readback

### Phase 1Oa

- Added full-precision planar Y/Cb/Cr DDR3 writes.
- Serialized block persistence so the parser could not advance until reconstructed block data reached DDR.
- Kept the existing on-chip framebuffer active temporarily to isolate DDR-write verification.

### Phase 1Ob

- Removed the large full-picture on-chip framebuffer.
- Added DDR3 readback through small dual-clock ping-pong line caches.
- Restored full 8-bit chroma presentation.
- Moved decoder frame storage away from the MiSTer system-video DDR region after identifying an address collision.
- Reduced M10K use dramatically compared with full-frame on-chip storage.

## Phase 1N — Full color reconstruction

- Added Cb and Cr to the serialized inverse-quantization, IDCT, and reconstruction pipeline.
- Implemented 4:2:0 component storage and BT.601 YCbCr-to-RGB conversion.
- Proved the first complete color picture in hardware.
- Used a temporary reduced-chroma on-chip storage format before the later DDR architecture removed the M10K pressure.

## Phase 1M — Complete first picture

- Continued parsing across all slices of the first supported I picture.
- Correctly reset slice-local DC predictors and macroblock address state.
- Produced the first complete 720x480 grayscale MPEG-2 picture.

## Phase 1L — Complete slice decode

- Removed the temporary fixed macroblock-count stop.
- Decoded an entire slice.
- Used H.262 slice termination rather than assuming a fixed row length.

## Phase 1K — Streaming bitreader

- Replaced the bounded whole-slice capture buffer with a streaming bitreader.
- Added exact byte/bit consumption and FIFO backpressure while downstream arithmetic was busy.
- Removed an implementation capture limit that had previously appeared as a decode failure.

## Phase 1J — Multi-macroblock diagnostics

- Expanded decode beyond the first macroblock.
- Parsed Cb/Cr block syntax sufficiently to advance through consecutive 4:2:0 intra macroblocks.
- Added detailed diagnostics that localized a failure to exhaustion of the temporary slice capture buffer.

## Phase 1I — First full luma macroblock

- Decoded all four Y blocks of the first 4:2:0 intra macroblock.
- Produced a stable 16x16 decoded luma region in hardware.

## Phase 1H — Legacy decoder removed from active build

- Removed MPEG2FPGA and its DDR bridge from the active Quartus design.
- Retained the source tree only as a frozen reference implementation.
- Reduced FPGA resource usage substantially and improved hardware stability.

## Phase 1G — Independent display timing

- Decoupled display timing from the legacy decoder.
- Added a fixed 800x600 / 40 MHz diagnostic timing generator.
- Eliminated raster shifts caused by the earlier timing path.

## Earlier clean-decoder milestones

- Began a standards-driven H.262 decoder.
- Parsed slice and first intra-macroblock syntax.
- Decoded intra DC and AC VLC data, including run/level and end-of-block handling.
- Implemented inverse quantization.
- Implemented a fixed-point two-pass 8x8 IDCT.
- Displayed the first decoded 8x8 luma block.
